title: Add tests using real GR solution examples

context: |
  Current tests rely mostly on synthetic or minimal examples. We need coverage
  using real general relativity solutions to validate tensor operations and
  curvature helpers against known results.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Tests include at least two GR solutions with known analytic results (e.g., Schwarzschild, FLRW, de Sitter)
  - Each new test asserts a verifiable invariant or equation outcome (e.g., R=0 for vacuum, Ricci scalar value)
  - Tests pass with `python -m pytest`
